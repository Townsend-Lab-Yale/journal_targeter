### <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> How to generate a references RIS file

The following instructions address a range of common scenarios.


##### <i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> My references are in a Google Doc, added by the Paperpile add-on.

- Bring up the Paperpile sidebar using Add-ons > Paperpile > Manage Citations.
- Click the gear icon, then select 'Export'.
- Under Export references, choose 'RIS' then 'Export references' to download a RIS file.


##### <i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> My references can be selected in a reference manager.

- **Mendeley**: select the manuscript references and export with File > Export,
  choosing RIS in format dropdown.
- **Zotero**: If manuscript references are stored in a collection: select
  'Export Collection...' in collection context menu; alternatively right/alt
  click selected references and choose 'Export Items...'. Choose RIS format
  with encoding 'UTF-8 without BOM'.
- **EndNote**: Select all references in manuscript (found under Imported
  References if you followed Step 2). Go to File > Export, then make the
  following selections:
  *Save file as type*: **Text only**;
  *Output style*: **RefMan (RIS) Export** (find under 'Select Another Style...'
  if necessary); tick 'Export Selected References'.



##### <i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> My references are in plain text.

2. Use **anystyle.io** to convert plain text references (e.g. in the bibliography
    section) to BibTex (\*.bib) format.
    - Paste your references text at [https://anystyle.io/](https://anystyle.io/).
      AnyStyle can extract metadata (journal, authors, title etc.) from a wide range
      of bibliographic styles.
    - In parsed output, check labels look accurate, reassigning if necessary:
      it is important the journal is identified for each reference.
    - Download as BibTex.

3. Import BibTex file into your reference management software. If you don't have
    reference management software installed, download [**Mendeley**](https://www.mendeley.com/downloads)
    or [**Zotero**](https://www.zotero.org/download).
    - **Mendeley**: create a folder ('Create Folder...' button is under My Library),
      then with folder selected, import `bib` file with File > Import > BibTex.
    - **Zotero**: load bib file using File > Import; under 'Options' tick "Place
      imported collections and items into new collections"
    - **EndNote**: Right/alt-click BIB file, and 'Open With' EndNote (as importing
      from the EndNote interface may not work).

4. Now follow the steps in "When references can be selected in a reference manager".


##### <i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> My references are embedded in a Word document.

Note: If selecting the references in the originating reference manager is non-trivial,
    use the steps in the previous section.

- If you used Mendeley or Zotero to add the references, you can upload the doc to
    [Reference Extractor](https://rintze.zelle.me/ref-extractor/)
    (by [Rintze Zelle](https://rintze.zelle.me/)) which can generate a
    RIS file for you.
- If you used an EndNote plug-in to add references, in the EndNote toolbar of
    Microsoft Word, go to Tools > Export Traveling Library, and create a new EndNote
    library. When you open this library in EndNote, you can export to RIS as explained
    in the previous section ("My references can be selected in a reference manager").
