###### Powered by [**Jane**](https://jane.biosemantics.org/)

Title and abstract text are processed by [Jane](https://jane.biosemantics.org/),
    a.k.a. the "Journal/Author Name Estimator". Jane uses the Lucene search engine
    to identify 50 articles that most closely match the search text, with each
    article assigned a similarity score. In the Jane interface, journals are
    presented in descending order of the sum of similarity scores, as a way of
    ranking match quality to the input text.

###### Extended journal statistics

This app builds on Jane search results, gathering articles and their similarity scores
    from separate searches of the title and abstract text. The number of articles
    matching each journal is used in conjunction with the uploaded references file
    to produce a `CAT` score: the sum of `C`itations for the journal among the
    references, and the number of journal articles in the `A`bstract search and
    `T`itle search. The app presents `CAT` scores, aggregated similarity statistics,
    and several flavors of journal impact metrics to help inform the choice of
    suitable target journals for your manuscript.
