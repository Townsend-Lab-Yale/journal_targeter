**The `Prospect` metric**

`Prospect` is a crude proxy for 'chance of your manuscript being
    accepted'. The metric attempts to capture the ratio of 'things in your favor'
    to 'all considerations, for or against you'. Here, 'things in
    your favor' include:

- Number of times the journal is cited in your references (`C`).
- Number of similar articles in the journal returned from a
    [Jane](https://jane.biosemantics.org/) search* of:
    1. your abstract text (`A`).
    2. your title (`T`).

Favorable traits are each given equal weight, so that citing a journal once is
    as beneficial to your odds as there being one article from the journal that
    appeared in the Jane abstract search.

Counting against you is the 'impact' (`I`) of the journal, following the assumption
    that acceptance rate decreases as the impact metric goes up. A weighting
    factor, `w`, determines how impact is weighed against favorable traits:
    1 unit of impact counts against you as much as `w` articles count in your favor.

`Prospect` = (`C` + `A` + `T`) / (`C` + `A` + `T` + `wI`)

**Plot features**

The prospect plot lets you:

- pan and zoom,
- load the NLM journal record by tapping a marker,
- see extended info via hover tooltips,
- box-select journals to activate in other tabs.
